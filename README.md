## üåü About The Project

This project investigates the classic financial question: "Do news announcements affect a company's stock price?" It provides a complete pipeline to answer this, focusing on Toyota as a case study.

**The pipeline consists of three core phases:**
1.  **Data Engineering:** A robust pipeline that collects financial data, scrapes news release dates from the web, and stores everything in a high-performance ClickHouse database via Docker.
2.  **Impact Analysis:** Using both descriptive statistics and a rigorous **Event Study** methodology, the project quantifies the abnormal returns generated around news event dates, isolating the news impact from general market trends.
3.  **Predictive Modeling:** The enriched dataset is used to train three different machine learning models (XGBoost, LSTM, and Transformer) to predict the direction of the stock price on the following day.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

This project utilizes a modern data science stack:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
* [XGBoost](https://xgboost.ai/)
* [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)
* [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.9+**
* **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
* An **Alpha Vantage API Key** for financial data.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/E-sanchez03/car-release-finance.git](https://github.com/E-sanchez03/car-release-finance.git)
    cd car-release-finance
    ```

2.  **Create and Configure a Credentials File:**
    Create a file named `credenciales.env` in the project root.
    ```env
    # File: credenciales.env
    CH_USER=user
    CH_PASSWORD=password
    ALPHA_VANTAGE_API=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

3.  **Launch the Database:**
    This command will start the ClickHouse database in a Docker container.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4.  **Set up a Python Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv
    
    # Activate it (Windows)
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # Or on macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    # Install required packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: If a `requirements.txt` file is not present, you can create one with `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing the packages mentioned in the Tech Stack).*

## üöÄ Usage

Execute the pipeline scripts sequentially from the project's root directory. It's highly recommended to use the `-m` flag, as it ensures Python's path resolution works correctly.

1.  **Initialize the Database:**
    ```bash
    python -m src.1_data_pipeline.initialize_database
    ```

2.  **Load Financial Data:**
    ```bash
    python -m src.1_data_pipeline.load_to_clickhouse
    ```

3.  **Enrich Data with News Events:**
    ```bash
    python -m src.1_data_pipeline.enrich_data
    ```

4.  **Perform Impact Analysis (Optional):**
    ```bash
    python -m src.2_analysis.analyze_impact_descriptive
    python -m src.2_analysis.analyze_impact_event_study
    ```

5.  **Train Machine Learning Models:**
    ```bash
    python -m src.3_modeling.train_xgboost
    python -m src.3_modeling.train_lstm
    python -m src.3_modeling.train_transformer
    ```

## üìä Results

The analysis phase yielded several key insights:

* **Descriptive Analysis:** On average, days with news announcements show slightly higher absolute price returns and a larger trading volume compared to days without news.
* **Event Study:** The analysis reveals a statistically significant **Post-Announcement Drift**. The market reacts positively on the day of the news, but continues to incorporate the information over the next 5 trading days, resulting in a cumulative abnormal return of over **+1.25%**. This suggests a market inefficiency in processing this type of news.
* **Predictive Models:** The performance of the three models (XGBoost, LSTM, Transformer) can be compared to evaluate the trade-offs between complexity and predictive accuracy for this specific task.
